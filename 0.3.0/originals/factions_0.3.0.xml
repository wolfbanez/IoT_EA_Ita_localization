			<loreText>_As the Titan "*gold rush*" ramped up, many startups and corporations from *Earth*, *Mars*, and the *asteroid belt* have scrambled to snap up ruin-rich land and start their own urban businesses. 
			|
			|The *Landfallers* faction is this swirling, leaderless group of striving hopefuls from across the System. They're people who dreamed big and have probably tasted failure. They also share a common 			*hyper-capitalist culture*. *Landfallers* are motivated by their perilous position and the powerful rewards of success. 
			|
			|Every once in a while, these ventures can be incredibly successful. A few are already on their way to becoming full-fledged Factions on Titan.

			|*Will you be the one who leads them to System dominance?*_</loreText>
