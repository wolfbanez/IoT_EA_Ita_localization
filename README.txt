Industries of Titan Fan Italian Localization

This the the unofficial localization of Industries of Titan.
We are currently working to translate every aspect that we found in the game files.

Localization got easier! The only file you need is located here:

\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\TextData\

Our goal is to provide most, if not all the translatable text in the game.

Localized files will be in a "version" directory, to identify what version of the game they localize. The game can still run if the version is updated, you'll only get some unlocalized strings.


>>> CURRENT LOCALIZED STABLE VERSION: 0.6.0 <<<

>>> CURRENT LOCALIZED EXPERIMENTAL VERSION: 0.6.0  <<<

HOW TO INSTALL Localization

1) Download localized files from GitHub
2) Go here: \IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\TextData\
4) Copy the localized loc_it.txt into the directory, no need to rewrite any other files
4b) If updating the translation, simply overwrite the loc_it.txt
5) Run the game
6) Go to Settings -> Gameplay -> go down until you find translation
7) Select the italian translation and restart the game

HOW TO BE NOTIFIED OF UPDATES

Go to Settings -> Notifications and enter your email address to receive updates for the localization! (I hope it works!)


PAY ATTENTION: if the game crashes while using the translation, look if you have the latest translation installed and try eventually to put the original english files before sending a bugsplat. I'm trying to preserve at best the game files, but errors could occur
