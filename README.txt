Industries of Titan Fan Italian Localization

This the the unofficial localization of Industries of Titan.
We are currently working to translate every aspect that we found in the game files.

Right now we identified:

\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\TextData\GameStringTable.txt
Contains most of the game text.


\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\gameModes.xml
\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\mapLocations.xml
\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\factions.xml
\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\tutorial.xml
\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\ui.xml
Contains tutorial texts, UIs, game modes, faction infos and more.

Our goal is to provide most, if not all the translatable text in the game.

Localized files will have a version file to identify what version of the game was used to translate them, in case the files are changed with the game updating.

WARNING: some XML files aren't localized at the moment, they will be uploaded shortly
