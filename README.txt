Industries of Titan Fan Italian Localization

This the the unofficial localization of Industries of Titan.
We are currently working to translate every aspect that we found in the game files.

Right now we identified:

\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\TextData\GameStringTable.txt
Contains most of the game text.

\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\gameModes.xml
\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\mapLocations.xml
\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\factions.xml
\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\tutorial.xml
\IndustriesOfTitan\Titan\Content\XML\ui.xml
Contains tutorial texts, UIs, game modes, faction infos and more.

Our goal is to provide most, if not all the translatable text in the game.

Localized files will have a version file to identify what version of the game was used to translate them, in case the files are changed with the game updating.

HOW TO BE NOTIFIED OF UPDATES

Go to Settings -> Notifications and enter your email address to receive updates for the localization! (I hope it works!)


PAY ATTENTION: if the game crashes while using the translation, look if you have the latest translation installed and try eventually to put the original english files before sending a bugsplat. I'm trying to preserve at best the game files, but errors could occur
